2. Include proper attribution in this file
3. Use descriptive filenames
4. Consider image size and loading performance

## Recommended Local Storage Strategy

1. Reduce dependency on external services
2. Improve loading speed
3. Prevent display issues if Unsplash changes URLs

Suggested local filenames:
